  # Chapter Overview

  Here is an example of additional context that can be added with markdown.

  ## Basic syntax

  You can use standard markdown tables and formatting

  | Tables   |      Are      |  Cool |
  |----------|:-------------:|------:|
  | col 1 is |  left-aligned | $1600 |
  | col 2 is |    centered   |   $12 |
  | col 3 is | right-aligned |    $1 |
